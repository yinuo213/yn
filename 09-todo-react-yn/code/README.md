# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run deploy`

**PREREQUISITE: Edit the `homepage` field in `package.json` file and replace "GROUPNAME" with the name of your group.**

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

Your app will then be deployed to the `gh-pages` branch of your github repository.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
